            Hi, I am <span className="main-name">Rachit Singhal</span> a Full
            Stack Developer, Competitive Programmer and Environment enthusiast.
            <br />
            For web development I uses MERN stack. I primarily uses React and
            Redux for frontend development. I am experienced in building RESTful
            APIs using Node.js and express, User Auth with PassportJS and
            Firebase.
            <br />I am also a competitive programmer and love to participate in
            contests with a passion of improving myself with every passing
            contest. Besides all these tech stuffs, I consider myself a chess
            player alsoðŸ™‚.
          </p>
